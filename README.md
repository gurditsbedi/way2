NOTE: There is limit on length of the sms according to the website which is 140 characters. The message you send is truncated to 140 chars and then it is send.

#Example

`way2 -u 987XXXXXXX -p password -t 801XXXXXXX -m "Hey, Where are you?"`

#Aliasing for shell users

If you are on a platform which has bash, zsh etc you would like to alias, because its too much typing for too less. Just and this following lines to your `~/.bash_aliases` in case of bash and you get `way2up` and `way2me ` commands.
```
alias way2up='way2 -u 987XXXXXXX -p password'
alias way2me='way2 -u 987XXXXXXX -p password -t 987XXXXXXX'
```


* `way2up`: In this one you have your mobile number and password stored just you have to provide reciever number and message.
* `way2me`: In this one you send message to yourself.

#Issues

* In India you are only allowed to send 100 sms per day per user, so the condition also applies here. This tool does not detect how many messages you have send on a day, so when you try send message after crossing this limit it will give positive reponse.

* When you cross the Indian daily sms limit, instead of giving negative respose will give positive response.

#Privacy

* The tool does not record an data such as mobile number, password or message. As the app is open-source you can review all of its code on GitHub to make sure itâ€™s not logging or transmitting data somewhere.
